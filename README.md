# Civ4-Archid

## Setup
The easy way to develop and play this mod is to have the git clone in a separate location from your Civ IV mod files and create a link between them using the following syntax:
`mklink /J <Path to Civ4 mod folder>\Archid <path to mod folder in git clone>`
e.g.
`mklink /J "%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Archid" "E:\Projects\Civ4\github\Civ4-Archid.git\mod"`

## Shortcut Keys
There are several additional screens available with the mod that are accessed via shortcut keys rather than UI buttons:

### Platy UI

## Issue Management
Issue management is  primarily tracked in a personal JIRA repository that is not available publically. Issues that are raised in GitHub will be reviewed and added to JIRA if appropriate and the GitHub issue will be updated accordingly.
